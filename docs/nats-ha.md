# High-Availability Deployment (NATS Mode)

Harnx supports a distributed, high-availability (HA) mode backed by [NATS JetStream](https://nats.io/). In this mode, the agent tool loop runs in a dedicated **worker** process, while thin **clients** (TUI or CLI) connect to the worker via a NATS cluster.

## Architecture Overview

Harnx NATS mode decouples the execution of an agent from the user interface:

- **Clients**: Thin processes (TUI and CLI) that post user messages and render events. They do not execute tools.
- **NATS Cluster**: The central nervous system. Uses JetStream for a durable session log and Key-Value (KV) for leader election (leases).
- **Workers**: One or more daemon processes that execute the agent loop. Multiple workers provide redundancy; only one worker holds the active lease for a given session at a time.

## Prerequisites

- **NATS Server 2.11+**: Requires JetStream and Key-Value support.
- **Configuration**: A NATS cluster configuration file in your `nats_servers/` directory.

## Standing up NATS

For development, a single NATS server with JetStream is sufficient:

```bash
nats-server -js
```

For production HA, run a NATS cluster with at least 3 nodes and set `replicas: 3`
in the cluster's `nats_servers/<cluster_key>.yaml` (see the production example
below) so the buckets harnx creates survive losing a node.

### JetStream Resources
Harnx automatically manages the following JetStream resources:
- **KV Bucket**: `harnx_leases` — session leases with a tombstone marker
  after release (not a bucket-wide TTL). This is the split-brain guard:
  every durable write is fenced on the lease's KV revision, and a worker
  that loses its lease aborts. If this bucket can't survive a node loss,
  neither can a session mid-turn on that node.
- **KV Bucket**: `harnx_sessions` — the session enumeration index. No expiry.
- **KV Bucket**: `harnx_tool_registry` — tool server discovery, with a
  per-registration TTL.
- **KV Buckets**: `harnx_hook_registry` and `harnx_hook_expectations` — hook
  server discovery and its fail-closed fallback routes. Only the copies
  opened by the standalone `harnx-hookset-server` binary carry a TTL; the
  worker daemon's own copy of the same buckets does not set one.
- **Streams**: `SESSION_<id>` (Subject: `sessions.{id}.log`) stores the durable append-only session history.

All of the KV buckets above are created with the `replicas` count from the
cluster's config (`None` means 1, no HA). Set it to 3 to match a 3-node
cluster; a mismatch between the two is what leaves a bucket unable to
tolerate a node loss.

**A bucket that has never existed before is created, not reconciled**, so
`replicas` above what the cluster can actually provide (e.g. a production
`replicas: 3` config pointed at a single-node dev server, before any of
these buckets exist) makes creation fail outright, and harnx will not start
against that cluster. This is intentional: failing loudly on a
misconfiguration is better than silently running at `replicas: 1` while an
operator believes they have HA. It only affects buckets that don't exist
yet — a bucket created earlier at a lower `replicas` and later pointed at a
higher one gets raised in place instead.

**Reconcile only ever raises `replicas`, never lowers it.** Some callers
(the hourly remote-session GC lease, for one) don't necessarily know the
cluster's actual configured value at the point they touch a bucket; if
reconcile lowered on request, one of those callers could silently downgrade
an already-correctly-replicated bucket's fault tolerance. Genuinely scaling
a bucket down requires recreating it.

## Configuration

Harnx looks for NATS cluster definitions in `nats_servers/<cluster_key>.yaml`. The filename (stem) is used as the cluster key.

### Example: Development (Plaintext)
`nats_servers/local.yaml`:
```yaml
url: "nats://localhost:4222"
```

### Example: Production (Token + TLS)
`nats_servers/prod.yaml`:
```yaml
url: "nats://nats.example.com:4222"
token: "${NATS_TOKEN}"
replicas: 3   # JetStream replica count for buckets harnx creates; defaults to 1
tls: true
tls_cert: "/etc/harnx/client-cert.pem"
tls_key: "/etc/harnx/client-key.pem"
# Note: tls_ca + client cert is NOT supported; use trusted certs or drop tls_ca.
```
*Note: Environment variable expansion `${ENV_VAR}` is supported in all fields.*

## Running Workers

A worker is its own binary, `harnx-worker`. It joins a cluster and waits for
session assignments.

```bash
harnx-worker --cluster local --worker-id worker-1
```

- `--cluster`: The key from `nats_servers/`.
- `--worker-id`: (Optional but recommended) A stable identity for the worker.

For the default local cluster you don't run this yourself: `harnx` and
`harnx-serve` spawn `harnx-worker` themselves. They look for it at
`HARNX_WORKER_BIN` first, then next to the running front-end, then on `PATH` —
so normally the worker just has to be installed alongside the front-end.

You can run multiple workers for redundancy. If the active worker for a session dies, another worker will acquire the lease and resume execution.

## Using Remote Agents

To use an agent via NATS, append `@cluster` to the agent name:

```bash
harnx -a coder@local
```

This works from the CLI and TUI.

- **New Sessions**: A new session log and lease are created in NATS.
- **Resuming Sessions**: Clients attach to an existing `session_id`. Multiple clients can attach to the same session simultaneously (Multiplayer Mode).

## Agent Catalog (Static Discovery)

To make remote agents discoverable in shell completion and interactive pickers, you can declare them in your cluster configuration.

Add an `agents:` list to `nats_servers/<cluster>.yaml`:

```yaml
url: "nats://nats.example.com:4222"
agents:
  - name: atlas
    description: "Main orchestrator"  # Reserved for future use / stored only
    role: assistant                # Optional: 'assistant' (default) or 'subagent'
  - name: critic
    role: subagent
```

### Discovery Behavior

- **Naming**: Agents appear as `name@cluster`. For example, `name: atlas` in `prod.yaml` surfaces as `atlas@prod`.
- **Filtering**:
    - **Shell Completion**: All agents appear in `--list-agents` and tab-completion regardless of role.
    - **Assistant Picker**: Only agents with `role: assistant` (the default) appear in interactive assistant selection menus. `subagent` entries are excluded from the picker.
- **Static Config**: This is purely local configuration. Harnx does not perform network calls to discover or list these agents.

## Control Plane

Clients communicate with the active worker over specific NATS subjects:
- **Cancel**: `sessions.{id}.control` — Deliver a cancel command to the worker.
- **Set Pending**: Update the pending user message without triggering execution.

Semantics are consistent because the authoritative state is derived from the durable JetStream log.

## Multi-Client Support

Multiple clients can attach to a single session:
1.  Clients replay the **durable history** from the JetStream stream.
2.  Clients subscribe to **live advisory events** on `sessions.{id}.events` for real-time updates (streaming chunks, tool progress).

Late-joining clients automatically converge to the same state by replaying the durable log.

## Failover & Safety

### Leases & Fencing
Harnx uses a renewable CAS (Compare-And-Swap) lease in NATS KV:
- **TTL**: ~30 seconds.
- **Renewal**: Every ~10 seconds.
- **Fence Token**: The KV revision of the lease. Every write to the durable log is gated by this token.

If a worker loses its lease (e.g., network partition), it immediately aborts. This prevents "split-brain" scenarios where two workers think they are active.

### Resume & Idempotency
When a worker resumes an interrupted session:
- **Idempotent Tools**: Tools marked with `idempotent_hint` or `read_only_hint` in MCP are re-run if their result was lost.
- **Non-idempotent Tools**: If a result is missing for a non-idempotent tool, Harnx synthesizes an "interrupt-error" result to prevent accidental double-execution of side effects.

## Cleanup

Session logs and leases persist in JetStream until explicitly deleted.

```bash
harnx session delete <session_id> --cluster local
```

## Observability

### Logs
Workers emit structured logs for:
- Lease acquisition, renewal, and loss.
- Fenced-write rejections.
- Session activation and failover.

### Metrics
Harnx tracks internal counters (exported to logs and future metrics endpoints):
- `active_sessions_per_worker`: Current active loops.
- `lease_acquisitions` / `lease_losses`: Lease churn.
- `fenced_writes_rejected`: Safety triggers.
- `interrupt_errors_synthesized`: Data points on failover impact.

## TLS Support Note
Harnx supports TLS and mTLS for NATS connections. While token authentication and config-based TLS have been verified, automated PKI-backed integration tests for live TLS handshakes are ongoing.
