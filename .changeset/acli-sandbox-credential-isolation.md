Close a Linux sandbox security gap where sandboxed processes could reach the host DBus session bus and read every OS keyring secret via the Secret Service. The default exec allowlist no longer includes top-level `/run` or `/var/run` — these are replaced with a least-privilege list of specific `/run` subpaths (`systemd/resolve`, `resolvconf`, `NetworkManager`, `current-system`, `opengl-driver`, `opengl-driver-32`, `udev`), explicitly excluding `/run/user` and `/run/dbus`. The `XDG_*` environment passthrough (in both the bash MCP server and the standalone `harnx-sandbox-run` runner) is now a deny-by-default whitelist of the XDG Base Directory Specification variables (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_BIN_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`); `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and desktop-session/seat variables are no longer forwarded, so DBus clients can no longer locate the session bus.

`harnx-proxy-auth` gains generic, product-agnostic primitives:

- `--load-yaml`/`--load-json`/`--load-raw <name>=<path>` — load a file at startup and expose it as the jaq variable `$<name>` in all jaq contexts (`--hook`, `--env`, `--fs`). A missing or malformed file yields `null` rather than aborting.
- `--load-exec <name>=<command>` — run a shell command at startup (`sh -c`, inheriting the proxy's host env) and expose its captured stdout as the jaq string variable `$<name>`. Any failure (non-zero exit, empty output, missing tool) yields `null`. The captured value is treated as a secret and never logged.
- `--fs <jaq>` — a transformer (like `--env`) whose output object maps paths (relative to `$temp_file_root`) to string file contents, written into a private `0700` temp dir the proxy creates and cleans up on exit/SIGTERM/SIGINT. Path traversal is rejected.
- `$temp_file_root` — a jaq binding holding the path of that temp dir (empty when no `--fs` is present).

The `coding` package's bash MCP server uses these to restore Atlassian CLI (`acli`) functionality inside the sandbox without keyring access: the proxy self-sources the real API token from the host OS keyring (`secret-tool` on Linux, `security` on macOS) via `--load-exec`, synthesizes a private `jira_config.yaml` containing the host's real `cloud_id`/`account_id` but a fixed sentinel token, points `acli` at it via `ACLI_CONFIG_DIR`, and the MITM proxy replaces the `Authorization` header with the real credentials before forwarding. This works from just `acli jira auth login` on the host — no `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`/`ATLASSIAN_EMAIL` environment variables and no manual keyring extraction are required. `--extra-read ~/.config/acli` is no longer needed. The injection no-ops cleanly when the user is not logged in (the keyring lookup yields `null`).
